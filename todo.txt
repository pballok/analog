- Run all greps for individual TempFiles, collect the grep results and sort them by timestamp.
- For each grep result, the following data needs to be stored:
      - id of TempFile
      - line number
      - timestamp
      - name of action
      - type of pattern (single, multi_start, multi_end, etc)
